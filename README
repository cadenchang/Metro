Program last edited: April 21, 2022

Overview of project:
- simulates a train moving from station to station
- train picks up any passengers waiting at the station and drops them off
at their specified destination
- passengers who successfully complete their trips are recorded in the 
outputfile

Compile with: make MetroSim
Run with: ./MetroSim [stationsfile] [outputfile] [commandsfile]

stationsfile: must be a file in the same directory with the name of each
station on a each line, will order the stations in the same order as file

outputfile: file that records which passenger got off the train and at which
station

commandsfile: (optional) file that gives a sequence of commands that program
can read in and execute

Examples of each file included: stations.txt, result.txt, commands.txt

Commands:
m m: move the train down one station
m f: finish program and print results to file
p [x] [y]: x and y must correspond to a station given in the stations file,
            must be a valid station number (ie can't give a station number of 
            30 if there are only 20 stations)
            x corresponds to the station a passenger starts at
            y corresponds to the station where the passenger gets off the train
